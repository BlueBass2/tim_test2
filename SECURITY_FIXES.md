# Security Fixes for PR #6 Issues

This document outlines the security vulnerabilities that were identified in Pull Request #6 and the fixes that have been implemented to address them.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Division by Zero (Runtime Exception)
**Issue**: Line 24 in PR #6 contained `result = result/0;` which would cause a runtime exception.
**Fix**: Removed the division by zero and added proper input validation for Height and Weight parameters.

### 2. Hardcoded Password (Security Vulnerability)
**Issue**: Line 31 in PR #6 contained `string password = "P@ssw0rd123";` which exposes sensitive credentials in source code.
**Fix**: Removed hardcoded password completely. Passwords should be stored in secure configuration files or environment variables.

### 3. Insecure Random Number Generation
**Issue**: Lines 33-34 in PR #6 used `Random` class for generating security tokens, which is not cryptographically secure.
**Fix**: Replaced with `RandomNumberGenerator.Create()` from `System.Security.Cryptography` for cryptographically secure random number generation.

### 4. Path Traversal Vulnerability
**Issue**: Line 37-38 in PR #6 constructed file paths using unsanitized user input: `"D:/some/directory/" + userInputFileName`.
**Fix**: 
- Added filename sanitization using `Path.GetFileName()`
- Implemented path validation to prevent directory traversal
- Used `Path.Combine()` for secure path construction
- Added validation to ensure final path stays within expected directory

### 5. SQL Injection Vulnerability
**Issue**: Line 44 in PR #6 used string interpolation in SQL query: `$"select * from any.USERS where user_name = '{userInput}'"`.
**Fix**: 
- Replaced with parameterized query using `@userName` parameter
- Added proper parameter binding with `command.Parameters.AddWithValue()`
- Sanitized input with null coalescing to empty string

### 6. Incomplete SQL Execution
**Issue**: Lines 46-48 in PR #6 created SQL command but never executed it, leaving DataTable empty.
**Fix**: Added proper SQL execution using `SqlDataAdapter` to populate the DataTable with query results.

## Additional Improvements

- Added necessary using statements for `System.IO` and `System.Security.Cryptography`
- Converted methods to static as indicated in the PR
- Added proper exception handling and input validation
- Added demonstration code in Main method to show the fixes work correctly

## Testing

The fixes have been implemented with proper error handling and input validation. The Main method includes demonstration code that shows:
- Safe BMI calculation with proper input validation
- Secure file handling with path sanitization
- Proper exception handling for error cases

All security vulnerabilities identified in the PR #6 review comments have been addressed.
